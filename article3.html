    <h1>Building a REST API with Spring Boot</h1>
    <img src="assets/img/spring-boot-rest-api.jpg" alt="Spring Boot REST API" class="img-fluid rounded-circle">

    <p>Building a secure and scalable REST API is an essential skill for modern Java developers. In this article, we'll walk through the process of building a REST API with Spring Boot, including essential features like JWT authentication and database integration.</p>

    <h2>1. Setting Up Spring Boot</h2>
    <p>To begin, we’ll set up a basic Spring Boot application using Spring Initializr, and configure it to support RESTful endpoints using Spring Web and JPA for database access.</p>

    <h2>2. Implementing JWT Authentication</h2>
    <p>Security is crucial when building APIs. We’ll implement JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to ensure secure access to the API. This will include creating a user model, a login endpoint, and a JWT filter for authorization.</p>

    <h2>3. Connecting to a Database</h2>
    <p>For storing and retrieving data, we’ll integrate Spring Data JPA with a relational database. We’ll cover creating entities, repositories, and endpoints to interact with the database efficiently.</p>

    <p>By the end of this article, you'll be able to build and secure a REST API using Spring Boot, ready to be used by clients and applications that need reliable, authenticated access.</p>
